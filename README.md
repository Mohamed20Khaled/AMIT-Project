It's an Electric Water Heater that I made using AVR ATmega32 chip. It consists of alot of modules such as ADC, EEPROM, SSD (Seven Segment Display), Basic Push Button, Led, Interrupts and the most important is the TIMER. I actually used two timers to calculate time between tasks. The heater uses the EEPROM to save the latest desired temperature the user modified.
